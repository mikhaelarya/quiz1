                <p>Surabaya is the capital city of East Java. It is known to many in Indonesia as the<br>
                City of Heroes. This is because of an event that happened in November 10th 1945, The Battle<br>
                of Surabaya. Lots have sacrificed themselves in that battle. Thus, every year in Indonesia,<br>
                there will always be an event as a reminder of that big event.<br><br>
                Today, Surabaya has become one of the largest cities in Indonesia. There are lots of people<br>
                living here. Sadly, due to that fact, pollution can be found almost everywhere</p>
